		<h3>Quality Assurance</h3><p>In the restaurant industry, the most critical objective to ensure the business smooth flow is to satisfy guestsâ€™ expectations from the moment they step in the restaurant up until they leave the store. The success or failure of a restaurant is tied to the quality of the product, service, and atmosphere. Customers expect only the best food that is properly prepared. They want pristine service from knowledgeable staff and they want an environment that is clean and comfortable. In order to consistently provide quality products and services, keeping a checklist of vital points to maintain daily is a necessity to keep customers coming back. To ensure the quality of products and services, certain measures are to be observed before, during, and after operation schedules. These measures are as follows.</p>
		<ul><b><li>Food</li></b><p>It is critical that food be fresh, prepared properly, and served at the right temperature. The presentation of the food is as vital as the taste. Consistency is the key to ensure quality to this. In order to achieve this, all kitchen staff and chefs should strictly follow the same preparation and cooking procedure for each dish</p><b><li>Back of House</li></b><p>Even if customers rarely see the kitchen, high standards in cleanliness and order in this area are keys to quality assurance. Food is to be rotated with each delivery to maintain the freshness of ingredients. Storage temperatures should be checked daily. Dry storage areas are kept clean and pest-free. Clean uniforms should always be worn by kitchen staff along with hairnets and proper footwear. All cooking and cleaning utensils should be maintained on a regular basis.</p><b><li>Front of House</li></b><p>The dining area should have a warm and invitingatmosphere, but most importantly clean and fresh. Floors should be swept and vacuumed daily, but notwhile customers are on the premises. Tables shouldbe wiped after each use and table cloths changed asneeded. All plates and utensils should be checkedfor cleanliness and sterilized before serving. Menusshould be clean and checked for spelling andTypographical errors before final printing. Windowsshould be wiped clean and restrooms should always beimmaculate.</p><b><li>Training and Management</li></b><p>Friendly and knowledgeable staff that entertain customers are an integral part of quality control in a restaurant. It is important that training is provided for all staff so that Consistency in customer service is maintained. Managers should know how to schedule shifts so that staff levels are high enough to provide quality service but are within budget. They need skills in conflict resolution to handle staff issues as well as customer complaints. Wait staff members need to be familiar with all menu items and be skilled in the art of up-selling (steering the customer to higher-price items). Cross-training is an excellent way to ensure quality standards in all areas of the restaurant</p></ul>
